# Adventure-Game

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a text-based adventure game called DnZ, or Definitely not Zork.  As of August 14th, 2018 it has an inventory system, a text parser, and a minimal map.  The goal is to make a game like Zork, although on a smaller level in order to get practice with Python and text parsing.
